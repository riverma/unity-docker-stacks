This file needs to be updated for every updates to leap seconds.

This file is sourced for the Sounder SIPS systems at:
smog.jpl.nasa.gov:/opt/packages/sdptk5.2.20v1.01/TOOLKIT/database/common/TD/leapsec.dat

This file is downloaded from a modified version of this script:
/opt/packages/sdptk5.2.20v1.01/TOOLKIT/bin/linux64/update_leapsec.sh
from:
https://cddis.nasa.gov/archive/products/iers/tai-utc.dat
which requires NASA Earthdata credentials. The TOOLKIT version of this script points
to an old deprecated location.

Our copy of the leapsec.dat file has been modified to be valid far into the future so as to not
require frequent updates. The toolkit currently thinks a leapsec.dat file is invalid if the
header indicates it is older than a time period of what seems to be about 80 days. The purposes
of this modification is to keep applications running without requring frequent updates even
if they might be slightly wrong outputs.
